# usage: deblob-check [-S] [-v] [-v] [-s S] [--reverse-patch] \
#        [--use-...|--gen-flex] [-lDdBbCcXxPpFftVh?H] \
#        *.tar* patch-* [-i prefix/] *.patch *.diff...

# Look for and report too-long undocumented sequences of numbers
# (generally blobs in disguise) in source files, as well as requests
# for loading non-Free firmware.

# The order of command line flags is significant.  Flags given out of
# the order above won't be handled correctly, sorry.

# -s --sensitivity: Specifies the number of consecutive integral or
#		character constants that trigger the blob detector.
#	        Must be followed by a blank and a number.

#    --reverse-patch: Test the removed parts of a patch, rather than
#		the added ones.

#    --use-python: Choose the internal python script for the bulk of
#		the work.  This is the fastest for cleaning up,
#		because of the fast startup time of the regular
#		expression engine.  This option is the default if
#		python is found.  Set PYTHON to override the python
#		interpreter.  The internal script works in both Python
#		2 and 3.

#    --use-awk: Choose the internal GNU awk script for the bulk of the
#		work.  This is the recommended option to check entire
#		tarballs, because its regular expression engine offers
#		the best speed/memory use.  This is the default option
#		if python is not found.  Set AWK to specify GNU awk's
#		name.

#    --use-perl: Choose the internal perl script.  This is not
#		recommended, because our regular expressions exceed
#		some limits hard-coded into perl.  Set PERL to specify
#		which perl implementation to use.  This is the default
#		option if neither python nor GNU awk are found, AND if
#		PERL is set.

#    --use-sed: Choose the internal GNU sed script for the bulk of the
#		work.  This is the default option, if no other
#		alternative is found.  Use SED to specify which sed
#		program to use.

#    --save-script-input: Save the input that would have been fed to
#		any of the engines above.

#    --gen-flex: Generate a flex input file with all known blob and
#		false positive patterns.  It might have been a fast
#		regular expression processor if only the flex program
#		completed in reasonable time.


# The default sensitivity is 32 constants.

# The sensitivity, if present, must be the first option.  The action
# selection, if present, must be the first argument, except for the
# sensitivity and verbosity.

# The default can be overridden with one of:

# -l --list-blobs: list files that contain sequences that match the
#		blob detector test and that are not known to be false
#		positives.  This is the default option.

# -d --deblob --mark-blobs: print the processed input, replacing
#		sequences that match the blob detector test and that
#		are NOT known to be false positives with
#		/*(DEBLOBBED)*/.

# -D --cat: print the processed input, as it would have been fed to
#		the blob detector script.  Use -S to save the sed
#		script used to process it, and search for `sedcat:' in
#		comments to locate the relevant adaptation points.

# -b --print-marked-blobs: like -d, but print only the matching
#		sequences.

# -B --print-blobs: like -b, but do not deblob the sequences.

# -c --print-marked-blobs-with-context: like -b, but try to maximize
#		the context around the blobs.  This maximization will
#		sometimes disregard known false positives, if they
#		happen to be contained within the extended match.
#		This is probably an indication that the false positive
#		matching rule could be improved.

# -C --print-blobs-with-context: like -B, but try to maximize the
#		context around the blobs.

# -X --print-all-matches: print all blobs, be they known false
#		positives or actual blobs.

# -x --list-all-matches: list files that contain sequences that appear
#		to be blobs, be they known false positives or not.

# -p --mark-false-positives: print the processed input, replacing
#		sequences that match the blob detector test, even those
#		known to be false positives, with /*(DEBLOBBED)*/.

# -P --list-false-positives: list files that contain false positives.

# -f --print-marked-false-positives: like -p, but print only the
#		matching sequences.

# -F --print-false-positives: like -f, but do not deblob the sequences.

# -t --test: run (very minimal) self-test.

# -V --version: print a version number

# -h -? -H --help: print short or long help message


# debugging options:

# -S --save-scripts: save scripts and temporary files.

# -v --verbose: increase verbosity level, for internal debugging.  May
#		be given at most twice.


# file options:

# --: Don't process command-line options any further.  All following
#		arguments are taken as filenames.

# -i --implied-prefix --prefix: prepend the given prefix to each filename
#		listed after this option, when configuring false positives
#		and negatives.

# *.tar*: iterate over all files in the named tar file.

# *.patch, patch-*, *.diff: Look for blobs in the [ +] parts of the
# 		*patch, unless --reverse-patch is given, in which case
# 		the [ -] parts will be used.

# Anything else is assumed to be a source file.

# *.gz | *.bz2 | *.xz | *.lz: Decompress automatically.


# The exit status is only significant for the --list options: it will
# be true if nothing was found, and false otherwise.

: # Mark the end of the help message.

# TODO:

# - Improve handling of command-line arguments, so as to not make the
# order relevant.

# - Add an option for the user to feed their own false positive
# patterns.

# - Add support to recognize known blobs (or other non-Free
# signatures, really), to speed up the scanning of files containing
# blobs, and to avoid attempts to disguise blobs.

# - Factor out the code in the various print_* and list_* parts of the
# sed script, at least in the shell sources.  Make sure they're all
# included and expanded in a saved --cat script though.

# - Add support for file name tagging in patterns, such that blobs or
# false positives are recognized only when handling the specific
# filename, be it stand-alone, as part of a patch or a tarball.  This
# should help avoid recognition of actual blobs as false positives
# just because there's a symbol with a different name elsewhere.

#   It is convenient that the patterns provided by the user to
# recognize file names can be empty (for backward compatibility), but
# this should ideally be phased out in favor of more precise matches.
# It's important that files can be recognized with leading tarball or
# patch names, that the filename used within the tarball contain
# leading garbage, and even that a partial pathname be recognizable
# (say recognize drivers/net/whatever.c when the input file is named
# ../net/whatever.c).

#   Rather than using regular expressions to recognize multiple files
# it's convenient (but not quite essential) that filename patterns be
# specifiable as regular expressions, rather than simple filenames,
# but there are other ways around this.

#   Maintaining begin/end markers in a stack-like fashion as part of
# the processed stream, and using the names in them as (optional) part
# of the recognition patterns, would enable us to do it.

#   Introducing annotations next to the false positives (and recognized
# blobs) as an early part of the process may speed things up and
# enable fast processing, but how to introduce the annotations quickly
# in the first place?  Given patterns such as

#   \(\(file1\)\(.*\)\(pat1\)\|\(file2\)\(.*\)\(pat2\)\|...\)

# how do we get sed to introduce a marker that contains file2 right
# before or right after pat2, without turning a big efficient regexp
# into a slowish sequence of s/// commands?

# - Re-check and narrow false-positive patterns to make sure they
# apply only to the relevant content.

# - Scripting abilities, so as to be able to automate the removal of
# source files or of blobs from source files in a tarball without
# having to extract the entire tarball (as in tar --update/--delete)
# would be nice.  Carrying over removed files automatically into
# patches would also be great, and this sort of script would be
# perfect to document what has been done to a tarball plus a set of
# patches.  Something like deblob.script:
#
#   tarball linux-2.6.24.tar.bz2
#   delete net/wireloss/freedom.c drivers/me/crazy.c
#   deblob include/linux/slab-blob-kfree.h
#   deconfig drivers/char/drm DRM_IS_BAD
#
#   patch patch-2.6.25-rc7.bz2
#   delete arch/power/over/you.c

# such that the deletes from an earlier file would carry over into the
# subsequent ones, and new tarballs and patch files would be generated
# with the libre- prefix in their basename, and the xdeltas between
# the original files and the modified files would be minimal, and
# redundant with this script and the input script while at that.

# - Improve documentation of the code.

# - Write a decent testsuite.

# - Insert your idea here. :-)

# Yeah, lots of stuff to do.  Want to help?

# This makes it much faster, and mostly immune to non-ASCII stuff, as
# long as a 8-bit-safe sed is used.  Probably a safe assumption these
# days.
