The scripts in this directory clean up and verify linux tarballs and
patches for non-Free blobs.  They're used to create the GNU
Linux-libre releases (see http://fsfla.org/se-libre/linux-libre/), but
you can use them to clean up and verify your own trees as well.

deblob-check looks for blobs in tarballs, source files and patches,
and performs a number of other tasks, such as cleaning up individual
source files from non-Free blobs, while retaining known Free and
apparent blobs.

deblob-<version> is to be run in an expanded Linux-<version> tree, to
clean it up from non-Free blobs.  As explained in the comments in the
script, if deblob-check is alongside it, it will be used to remove
only the blobs, otherwise entire files will be removed.  If you find a
++ in the assignment to extra, this means the script was modified
after the named release.  You might have to take the ++s out for the
script to run.  Feel Free to edit it however you see fit.

deblob-main is used to clean up a Linux tarball and create a GNU
Linux-libre tarball.  The comments in the script detail the arguments
it expects.  If you use it to deblob patched Linux trees, be sure to
run deblob-check on the result, to make sure blobs haven't been added
in the patches that it didn't know to clean up.

Be Free!
